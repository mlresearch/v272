title: An Online Feasible Point Method for Benign Generalized Nash Equilibrium Problems.
abstract: 'We consider a repeatedly played generalized Nash equilibrium game. This
  induces a multi-agent online learning problem with joint constraints. An important
  challenge in this setting is that the feasible set for each agent depends on the
  simultaneous moves of the other agents and, therefore, varies over time. As a consequence,
  the agents face time-varying constraints, which are not adversarial but rather endogenous
  to the system. Prior work in this setting focused on convergence to a feasible solution
  in the limit via integrating the constraints in the objective as a penalty function.  However,
  no existing work can guarantee that the constraints are satisfied for all iterations
  while simultaneously guaranteeing convergence to a generalized Nash equilibrium.
  This is a problem of fundamental theoretical interest and practical relevance. In
  this work, we introduce a new online feasible point method. Under the assumption
  that limited communication between the agents is allowed, this method guarantees
  feasibility. We identify the class of benign generalized Nash equilibrium problems,
  for which the convergence of our method to the equilibrium is guaranteed. We set
  this class of benign generalized Nash equilibrium games in context with existing
  definitions and illustrate our method with examples.  '
