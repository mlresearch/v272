title: Boosting, Voting Classifiers and Randomized Sample Compression Schemes
abstract: 'In Boosting, we aim to leverage multiple weak learners to produce a strong
  learner. At the center of this paradigm lies the concept of building the strong
  learner as a voting classifier, which outputs a weighted majority vote of the weak
  learners. While many successful Boosting algorithms, such as the iconic AdaBoost,
  produce voting classifiers, their theoretical performance has long remained sub-optimal:
  The best known bounds on the number of training examples necessary for a voting
  classifier to obtain a given accuracy has so far always contained at least two logarithmic
  factors above what is known to be achievable by general weak-to-strong learners.
  In this work, we break this barrier by proposing a randomized Boosting algorithm
  that outputs voting classifiers whose generalization error contains a single logarithmic
  dependency on the sample size. We obtain this result by building a general framework
  that extends sample compression methods to support randomized learning algorithms
  based on sub-sampling.'
