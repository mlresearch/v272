title: 'The Plug-in Approach for Average-Reward and Discounted MDPs: Optimal Sample
  Complexity Analysis'
abstract: We study the sample complexity of the plug-in approach for learning $\varepsilon$-optimal
  policies in average-reward Markov decision processes (MDPs) with a generative model.
  The plug-in approach constructs a model estimate then computes an average-reward
  optimal policy in the estimated model.  Despite representing arguably the simplest
  algorithm for this problem, the plug-in approach has never been theoretically analyzed.
  Unlike the more well-studied discounted MDP reduction method, the plug-in approach
  requires no prior problem information or parameter tuning. Our results fill this
  gap and address the limitations of prior approaches, as we show that the plug-in
  approach is optimal in several well-studied settings without using prior knowledge.
  Specifically it achieves the optimal diameter- and mixing-based sample complexities
  of $\widetilde{O}\left(SA \frac{D}{\varepsilon^2}\right)$ and $\widetilde{O}\left(SA
  \frac{\tau_{\mathrm{unif}}}{\varepsilon^2}\right)$, respectively, without knowledge
  of the diameter $D$ or uniform mixing time $\tau_{\mathrm{unif}}$. We also obtain
  span-based bounds for the plug-in approach, and complement them with algorithm-specific
  lower bounds suggesting that they are unimprovable. Our results require novel techniques
  for analyzing long-horizon problems which may be broadly useful and which also improve
  results for the discounted plug-in approach, removing effective-horizon-related
  sample size restrictions and obtaining the first optimal complexity bounds for the
  full range of sample sizes without reward perturbation.
