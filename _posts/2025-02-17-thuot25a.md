title: 'Clustering with bandit feedback: breaking down the computation/information
  gap'
abstract: " We investigate the Clustering with Bandit feedback Problem (CBP). A learner
  interacts with an $N$-armed stochastic bandit with $d$-dimensional subGaussian feedback.
  There exists a hidden partition of the arms into $K$ groups, such that arms within
  the same group, share the same mean vector. The learnerâ€™s task is to uncover this
  hidden partition with the smallest budget - i.e. the least number of observation
  - and with a probability of error smaller than a prescribed constant $\\delta$.
  In this paper, (i) we derive a non asymptotic lower bound for the budget, and (ii)
  we introduce the computationally efficient ACB algorithm, whose budget matches the
  lower bound in most regimes.  We improve on the performance of a uniform sampling
  strategy. Importantly, contrary to the batch setting, we establish that there is
  no computation-information gap in the bandit setting."
