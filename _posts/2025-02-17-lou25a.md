title: Computationally efficient reductions between some statistical models
abstract: We study the problem of approximately transforming a sample from a source
  statistical model to a sample from a target statistical model without knowing the
  parameters of the source model, and construct several computationally efficient
  such reductions between canonical statistical experiments. In particular, we provide
  computationally efficient procedures that approximately reduce uniform, Erlang,
  and Laplace location models to general target families. We illustrate our methodology
  by establishing nonasymptotic reductions between some canonical high-dimensional
  problems, spanning mixtures of experts, phase retrieval, and signal denoising. Notably,
  the reductions are structure-preserving and can accommodate missing data. We also
  point to a possible application in transforming one differentially private mechanism
  to another.
