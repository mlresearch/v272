title: A Characterization of List Regression
abstract: There has been a recent interest in understanding and characterizing the
  sample complexity of list learning tasks, where the learning algorithm is allowed
  to make a short list of $k$ predictions, and we simply require one of the predictions
  to be correct. This includes recent works characterizing the PAC sample complexity
  of standard list classification and online list classification. Adding to this theme,
  in this work, we provide a complete characterization of list PAC {\em regression}.
  We propose two combinatorial dimensions, namely the $k$-OIG dimension and the $k$-fat-shattering
  dimension, and show that they characterize realizable and agnostic $k$-list regression
  respectively. These quantities generalize known dimensions for standard regression.
  Our work thus extends existing list learning characterizations from classification
  to regression.
