title: Generalization bounds for mixing processes via delayed online-to-PAC conversions
abstract: We study the generalization error of statistical learning algorithms in a non
  i.i.d. setting, where the training data is sampled from a stationary mixing process.
  We develop an analytic framework for this scenario based on a reduction to online
  learning with delayed feedback. In particular, we show that the existence of an
  online learning algorithm with bounded regret (against a fixed statistical learning
  algorithm in a specially constructed game of online learning with delayed feedback)
  implies low generalization error of said statistical learning method even if the
  data sequence is sampled from a mixing time series. The rates demonstrate a trade-studied
  settings when the delay is tuned appropriately as a function of the mixing time
  of the process.
