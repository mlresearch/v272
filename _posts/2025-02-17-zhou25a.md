title: Logarithmic Regret for Unconstrained Submodular Maximization Stochastic Bandit
abstract: We address the <em>online unconstrained submodular maximization problem</em>
  (Online USM), in a setting with <em>stochastic bandit feedback</em>. In this framework,
  a decision-maker receives noisy rewards from a non monotone submodular function
  taking values in a known bounded interval. This paper proposes <em>Double-Greedy
  - Explore-then-Commit</em> (DG-ETC), adapting the Double-Greedy approach from the
  offline and online full-information settings. DG-ETC satisfies a $O(d\log(dT))$
  problem-dependent upper bound for the $1/2$-approximate pseudo-regret, as well as
  a  $O(dT^{2/3}\log(dT)^{1/3})$ problem-free one at the same time, outperforming
  existing approaches. In particular, we introduce a problem-dependent notion of hardness
  characterizing the transition between logarithmic and polynomial regime for the
  upper bounds.
