title: Full Swap Regret and Discretized Calibration
abstract: We study the problem of minimizing swap regret in structured normal-form
  games. Players have a very large (potentially infinite) number of pure actions,
  but each action has an embedding into $d$-dimensional space and payoffs are given
  by bilinear functions of these embeddings. We provide an efficient learning algorithm
  for this setting that incurs at most $\tilde{O}(T^{(d+1)/(d+3)})$ swap regret after
  $T$ rounds. To achieve this, we introduce a new online learning problem we call
  <em>full swap regret minimization</em>. In this problem, a learner repeatedly takes
  a (randomized) action in a bounded convex $d$-dimensional action set $\mathcal{K}$
  and then receives a loss from the adversary, with the goal of minimizing their regret
  with respect to the <em>worst-case</em> swap function mapping $\mathcal{K}$ to $\mathcal{K}$.
  For varied assumptions about the convexity and smoothness of the loss functions,
  we design algorithms with full swap regret bounds ranging from $O(T^{d/(d+2)})$
  to $O(T^{(d+1)/(d+2)})$. Finally, we apply these tools to the problem of online
  forecasting to minimize calibration error, showing that several notions of calibration
  can be viewed as specific instances of full swap regret. In particular, we design
  efficient algorithms for online forecasting that guarantee at most $O(T^{1/3})$
  $\ell_2$-calibration error and $O(\max(\sqrt{\epsilon T}, T^{1/3}))$ <em>discretized-calibration</em>
  error (when the forecaster is restricted to predicting multiples of $\epsilon$).
