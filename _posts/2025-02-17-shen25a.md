title: Efficient PAC Learning of Halfspaces with Constant Malicious Noise Rate
abstract: 'Understanding noise tolerance of machine learning algorithms is a central
  quest in learning theory. In this work, we study the problem of computationally
  efficient PAC learning of halfspaces in the presence of malicious noise, where an
  adversary can corrupt both instances and labels of training samples. The best-known
  noise tolerance either depends on a target error rate under distributional assumptions
  or on a margin parameter under large-margin conditions. In this work, we show that
  when both types of conditions are satisfied, it is possible to achieve constant
  noise tolerance by minimizing a reweighted hinge loss. Our key ingredients include:
  1) an efficient algorithm that finds weights to control the gradient deterioration
  from corrupted samples, and 2) a new analysis on the robustness of the hinge loss
  equipped with such weights.'
