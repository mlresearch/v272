title: Sharp bounds on aggregate expert error
abstract: We revisit the classic problem of aggregating binary advice from conditionally
  independent experts, also known as the Naive Bayes setting. Our quantity of interest
  is the error probability of the optimal decision rule. In the case of symmetric
  errors (sensitivity = specificity), reasonably tight bounds on the optimal error
  probability are known. In the general asymmetric case, we are not aware of any nontrivial
  estimates on this quantity. Our contribution consists of sharp upper and lower bounds
  on the optimal error probability in the general case, which recover and sharpen
  the best known results in the symmetric special case. Additionally, our bounds are
  apparently the first to take the bias into account. Since this  turns out to be
  closely connected to bounding the total variation distance between two product distributions,
  our results also have bearing on this important and challenging problem.
