title: Strategyproof Learning with Advice
abstract: An important challenge in robust machine learning is when training data
  is provided by strategic sources who may intentionally report erroneous data for
  their own benefit. A line of work at the intersection of machine learning and mechanism
  design aims to deter strategic agents from reporting erroneous training data by
  designing learning algorithms that are strategyproof. Strategyproofness is a strong
  and desirable property, but it comes at a cost in the approximation ratio of even
  simple risk minimization problems.  In this paper, we study strategyproof regression
  and classification problems in a model with advice. This model is part of a recent
  line on mechanism design with advice where the goal is to achieve both an improved
  approximation ratio when the advice is correct (consistency) and a bounded approximation
  ratio when the advice is incorrect (robustness). We provide the first non-trivial
  consistency-robustness tradeoffs for strategyproof regression and classification,
  which hold for simple yet interesting classes of functions. For classes of constant
  functions, we give a deterministic and strategyproof  mechanism that is, for any
  $\gamma \in (0, 2]$, $1+\gamma$ consistent and $1 + 4/\gamma$ robust and provide
  a lower bound that shows that this tradeoff is optimal. We extend this mechanism
  and its guarantees to homogeneous linear regression over $\mathbb{R}$. In the binary
  classification problem of selecting from three or more labelings, we present strong
  impossibility results for both deterministic and randomized mechanism. Finally,
  we provide deterministic and randomized mechanisms for selecting from two labelings.
