title: Is Transductive Learning Equivalent to PAC Learning?
abstract: 'Much of learning theory is concerned with the design and analysis of probably
  approximately correct (PAC) learners. The closely related transductive model of
  learning has recently seen more scrutiny, with its learners often used as precursors
  to PAC learners. Our goal in this work is to understand and quantify the exact relationship
  between these two models.  First, we observe that modest extensions of existing
  results show the models to be essentially equivalent for realizable learning for
  most natural loss functions, up to low order terms in the error and sample complexity.
  The situation for agnostic learning appears less straightforward, with sample complexities
  potentially separated by a $\frac{1}{\epsilon}$ factor. This is therefore where
  our main contributions lie. Our results are two-fold:  <ol> <li> For agnostic learning
  with bounded losses (including, for example, multiclass classification), we show
  that PAC learning reduces to transductive learning at the cost of low-order terms
  in the error and sample complexity. This is via an adaptation of the reduction of
  Aden-Ali et al. (2023a) to the agnostic setting. </li> <li> For agnostic binary
  classification, we show the converse: transductive learning is essentially no more
  difficult than PAC learning. Together with our first result this implies that the
  PAC and transductive models are essentially equivalent for agnostic binary classification.
  This is our most technical result, and involves two key steps: (a) A symmetrization
  argument on the agnostic one-inclusion graph (OIG) of Long (1998) to derive the
  worst-case agnostic transductive instance, and (b) expressing the error of the agnostic
  OIG algorithm for this instance in terms of the empirical Rademacher complexity
  of the class. </li> </ol> We leave as an intriguing open question whether our second
  result can be extended beyond binary classification to show the transductive and
  PAC models equivalent more broadly.'
