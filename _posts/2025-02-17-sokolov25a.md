title: Self-Directed Node Classification on Graphs
abstract: We study the problem of classifying the nodes of a given graph in the self-directed
  learning setup. This learning setting is a variant of online learning, where rather
  than an adversary determining the sequence in which nodes are presented, the learner
  autonomously and adaptively selects them. While self-directed learning of Euclidean
  halfspaces, linear functions, and general multiclass hypothesis classes was recently
  considered, no results previously existed specifically for self-directed node classification
  on graphs. In this paper, we address this problem developing efficient algorithms
  for it. More specifically, we focus on the case of (geodesically) convex clusters,
  i.e., for every two nodes sharing the same label, all nodes on every shortest path
  between them also share the same label. In particular, we devise an algorithm with
  runtime polynomial in $n$ that makes only $3(h(G)+1)^4 \ln n$ mistakes on graphs
  with two convex clusters, where $n$ is the total number of nodes and $h(G)$ is the
  Hadwiger number, i.e., the size of the largest clique minor of the graph $G$. We
  also show that our algorithm is robust to the case that clusters are slightly non-convex,
  still achieving a mistake bound logarithmic in $n$. Finally, we devise a simple
  and efficient algorithm for homophilic clusters, where strongly connected nodes
  tend to belong to the same class.
