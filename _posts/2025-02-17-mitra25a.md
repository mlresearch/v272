title: Fast Convergence of $Φ$-Divergence Along the Unadjusted Langevin Algorithm
  and Proximal Sampler
abstract: We study the mixing time of two popular discrete-time Markov chains in continuous
  space, the Unadjusted Langevin Algorithm and the Proximal Sampler, which are discretizations
  of the Langevin dynamics. We extend mixing time analyses for these Markov chains
  to hold in $\Phi$-divergence. We show that any $\Phi$-divergence arising from a
  twice-differentiable strictly convex function $\Phi$ converges to $0$ exponentially
  fast along these Markov chains, under the assumption that their stationary distributions
  satisfy the corresponding $\Phi$-Sobolev inequality, which holds for example when
  the target distribution of the Langevin dynamics is strongly log-concave. Our setting
  includes as special cases popular mixing time regimes, namely the mixing in chi-squared
  divergence under a Poincaré inequality, and the mixing in relative entropy under
  a log-Sobolev inequality. Our results follow by viewing the sampling algorithms
  as noisy channels and bounding the contraction coefficients arising in the appropriate
  strong data processing inequalities.
