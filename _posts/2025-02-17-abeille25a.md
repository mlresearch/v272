title: When and why randomised exploration works (in linear bandits)
abstract: We provide an approach for the analysis of randomised exploration algorithms
  like Thompson sampling that does not rely on forced optimism or posterior inflation.
  With this, we demonstrate that in the $d$-dimensional linear bandit setting, when
  the action space is smooth and strongly convex, randomised exploration algorithms
  enjoy an $n$-step regret bound of the order $O(d\sqrt{n} \log(n))$.  Notably, this
  shows for the first time that there exist non-trivial linear bandit settings where
  Thompson sampling can achieve optimal dimension dependence in the regret.
