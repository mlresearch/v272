title: A Complete Characterization of Learnability for Stochastic Noisy Bandits
abstract: 'We study the stochastic noisy bandit problem with an unknown reward function
  $f^*$ in a known function class $\mathcal{F}$. Formally, a model $M$ maps arms $\pi$
  to a probability distribution $M(\pi)$ of reward. A model class $\mathcal{M}$ is
  a collection of models. For each model $M$, define its mean reward function $f^M(\pi)=\mathbb{E}_{r
  \sim M(\pi)}[r]$.  In the bandit learning problem, we proceed in rounds, pulling
  one arm $\pi$ each round and observing a reward sampled from $M(\pi)$. With knowledge
  of $\mathcal{M}$, supposing that the true model $M\in \mathcal{M}$, the objective
  is to identify an arm $\hat{\pi}$ of near-maximal mean reward $f^M(\hat{\pi})$ with
  high probability in a bounded number of rounds. If this is possible, then the model
  class is said to be learnable.  Importantly, a result of Hanneke and Yang (2023)  shows
  there exist model classes for which learnability is undecidable. However, the model
  class they consider features deterministic rewards, and they raise the question
  of whether learnability is decidable for classes containing sufficiently noisy models.
  More formally, for any function class $\mathcal{F}$ of mean reward functions, we
  denote by $\mathcal{M}_{\mathcal{F}}$ the set of all models $M$ such that $f^M \in
  \mathcal{F}$. In other words, $\mathcal{M}_{\mathcal{F}}$ admits arbitrary zero-mean
  noise. Hanneke and Yang (2023)  ask the question: Can one give a simple complete
  characterization of which function classes $\mathcal{F}$ satisfy that $\mathcal{M}_{\mathcal{F}}$
  is learnable? For the first time, we answer this question in the positive by giving
  a complete characterization of learnability for model classes $\mathcal{M}_{\mathcal{F}}$.
  In addition to that, we also describe the full spectrum of possible optimal query
  complexities. Further, we prove adaptivity is sometimes necessary to achieve the
  optimal query complexity. Last, we revisit an important complexity measure for interactive
  decision making, the Decision-Estimation-Coefficient (Foster et al., 2021, 2023),
  and propose a new variant of the DEC which also characterizes learnability in this
  setting.'
