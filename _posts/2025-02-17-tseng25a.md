title: Online Learning of Quantum States with Logarithmic Loss via VB-FTRL
abstract: Online learning of quantum states with the logarithmic loss (LL-OLQS) is
  a quantum generalization of online portfolio selection (OPS), a classic open problem
  in online learning for over three decades. This problem also emerges in designing
  stochastic optimization algorithms for maximum-likelihood quantum state tomography.
  Recently, Jezequel et al. (2022, arXiv:2209.13932) proposed the VB-FTRL algorithm,
  the first regret-optimal algorithm for OPS with moderate computational complexity.
  In this paper, we generalize VB-FTRL for LL-OLQS. Let $d$ denote the dimension and
  $T$ the number of rounds. The generalized algorithm achieves a regret rate of $O
  ( d^2 \log ( d + T ) )$ for LL-OLQS. Each iteration of the algorithm consists of
  solving a semidefinite program that can be implemented in polynomial time by, for
  example, cutting-plane methods. For comparison, the best-known regret rate for LL-OLQS
  is currently $O ( d^2 \log T )$, achieved by an exponential weight method. However,
  no explicit implementation is available for the exponential weight method for LL-OLQS.
  To facilitate the generalization, we introduce the notion of VB-convexity. VB-convexity
  is a sufficient condition for the volumetric barrier associated with any function
  to be convex and is of independent interest.
