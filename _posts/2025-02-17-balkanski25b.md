title: Cost-Free Fairness in Online Correlation Clustering
abstract: 'In the correlation clustering problem, the input is a signed graph where
  the sign indicates whether pairs of nodes should be placed in the same cluster or
  not. The goal is to create a clustering that minimizes the number of disagreements
  with these signs. Correlation clustering is a key unsupervised learning problem
  with many practical applications. It has been widely studied in various settings,
  including versions with fairness constraints and cases where nodes arrive online.
  In this paper, we explore a problem that combines these two settings: nodes arrive
  online and reveal their membership in protected groups upon arrival. We are only
  allowed to output fair clusters, i.e., clusters where the representation of each
  protected group is upper bounded by a user-specified constant at the beginning of
  the arrival sequence. Our aim is to maintain approximately optimal fair clustering
  while minimizing a nodeâ€™s worst-case recourse, i.e., the number of times it changes
  clusters. We present an algorithm that achieves worst-case logarithmic recourse
  per node while maintaining a constant-factor fair approximate clustering. Additionally,
  our approach simplifies the algorithm and analysis used in prior work by Cohen-Addad
  et al. (2022) in the online setting with recourse.'
