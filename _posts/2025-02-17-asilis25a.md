title: Understanding Aggregations of Proper Learners in Multiclass Classification
abstract: 'Multiclass learnability is known to exhibit a properness barrier: there
  are learnable classes which cannot be learned by any proper learner. Binary classification
  faces no such barrier for learnability, but a similar one for optimal learning,
  which can in general only be achieved by improper learners. Fortunately, recent
  advances in binary classification have demonstrated that this requirement can be
  satisfied using aggregations of proper learners, some of which are strikingly simple.
  This raises a natural question: to what extent can simple aggregations of proper
  learners overcome the properness barrier in multiclass classification?  We give
  a positive answer to this question for classes which have finite Graph dimension,
  $d_G$. Namely, we demonstrate that the optimal binary learners of Hanneke, Larsen,
  and Aden-Ali et al. (appropriately generalized to the multiclass setting) achieve
  sample complexity $O\left( \frac{d_G + \ln(1 / \delta)}{\varepsilon}\right)$. This
  forms a strict improvement upon the sample complexity of ERM. We complement this
  with a lower bound demonstrating that for certain classes of Graph dimension $d_G$,
  majorities of ERM learners require $\Omega \left( \frac{d_G + \ln(1 / \delta)}{\varepsilon}\right)$
  samples. Furthermore, we show that a single ERM requires $\Omega \left(\frac{d_G
  \ln(1 / \varepsilon) + \ln(1 / \delta)}{\varepsilon}\right)$ samples on such classes,
  exceeding the lower bound of Daniel et al. (2015) by a factor of $\ln(1 / \varepsilon)$.
  For multiclass learning in full generality  — i.e., for classes of finite DS dimension
  but possibly infinite Graph dimension —  we give a strong refutation to these learning
  strategies, by exhibiting a learnable class which cannot be learned to constant
  error by any aggregation of a finite number of proper learners.'
