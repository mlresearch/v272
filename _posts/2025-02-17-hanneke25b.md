title: For Universal Multiclass Online Learning, Bandit Feedback and Full Supervision
  are Equivalent
abstract: 'We study the problem of multiclass online learning under \emph{bandit feedback}
  within the framework of \emph{universal learning} [Bousquet, Hanneke, Moran, van
  Handel, and Yehudayoff; STOC â€™21]. \par In multiclass online learning under bandit
  feedback, it is well known that no concept class $\mathcal{C}$ is \emph{uniformly}
  learnable when the effective label space is unbounded, or in other words, no online
  learner guarantees a finite bound on the expected number of mistakes holding uniformly
  over all realizable data sequences. In contrast, surprisingly, we show that in the
  case of \emph{universal} learnability of concept classes $\mathcal{C}$, there is
  an exact equivalence between multiclass online learnability under bandit feedback
  and full supervision, in both the realizable and agnostic settings. \par More specifically,
  our first main contribution is a theory that establishes an inherent dichotomy in
  multiclass online learning under bandit feedback within the realizable setting.
  In particular, for any concept class $\mathcal{C}$ even when the effective label
  space is unbounded, we have: (1) If $\mathcal{C}$ does not have an infinite multiclass
  Littlestone tree, then there is a deterministic online learner that makes only finitely
  many mistakes against any realizable adversary, crucially without placing a uniform
  bound on the number of mistakes. (2) If $\mathcal{C}$ has an infinite multiclass
  Littlestone tree, then there is a strategy for the realizable adversary that forces
  any learner, including randomized, to make linear expected number of mistakes. Furthermore,
  our second main contribution reveals a similar trend in the agnostic setting.'
