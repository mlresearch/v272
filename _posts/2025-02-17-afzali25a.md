title: Agnostic Private Density Estimation for GMMs via List Global Stability
abstract: We consider the problem of private density estimation for mixtures of unbounded
  high-dimensional Gaussians in the agnostic setting. We prove the first upper bound
  on the sample complexity of this problem. Previously, private learnability of high
  dimensional GMMs was only known in the realizable setting Afzali et al. (2024).
  To prove our result, we exploit the notion of \textit{list global stability} Ghazi
  et al. (2021) that was originally introduced in the context of supervised learning.
  We define an agnostic variant of this definition, showing that its existence is
  sufficient for agnostic private density estimation. We then construct an agnostic
  list globally stable learner for GMMs.
