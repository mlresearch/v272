title: Data Dependent Regret Bounds for Online Portfolio Selection with Predicted
  Returns
abstract: We study data-dependent regret bounds for the Online Portfolio Selection
  (OPS) problem. As opposed to worst-case bounds that hold uniformly over all sequence
  of returns, data-dependent bounds adapt to the specific sequence of returns seen
  by the investor. Consider a market of $n$ assets and $T$ time periods, consisting
  of the returns $r_1,…,r_T \in \mathbb{R}^n_+$. The regret of our proposed algorithm,
  Log-Barrier Adaptive-Curvature Online Newton Step (LB-AdaCurv ONS) is bounded by
  $O(\min(nR\log T, \sqrt{nT\log T}))$, where  $R = \max_{t,i,j} \frac{r_t(i)}{r_t(j)}$
  is a data dependent quantity that is not known to the algorithm. Thus, LB-AdaCurv
  ONS has a worst case regret of $O(\sqrt{nT \log T})$ while simultaneously having
  a data-dependent regret of $O(nR\log T)$.  Next, we consider the more practical
  setting of OPS with predicted returns, where the investor has access to predictions
  that can be incorporated into the portfolio selection process. We propose the Optimistic
  Expected Utility LB-FTRL (OUE-LB-FTRL) algorithm that incorporates the predictions
  using a utility function. If the predictions are accurate, OUE-LB-FTRL’s regret
  is $O(n \log T)$ and even if the predictions are arbitrary, regret is always bounded
  by $O(\sqrt{nT\log T})$. We provide a meta-algorithm called Best-of-Both Worlds
  for OPS (BoB-OPS), that combines the portfolios of an expected utility investor
  and a regret minimizing investor. By properly instantiating BoB-OPS, we show that
  the regret with respect to the expected utility investor is $O(\log T)$ and the
  static regret is $O(n \log T)$. Finally, we also show new First-Order, Second-Order
  and Gradual-Variation regret bounds for OPS. In our analysis, we developed new regret
  inequalities for optimistic FTRL with convex hint functions. This extends prior
  work on optimistic FTRL that used only linear hints, and so could be of independent
  interest.
