title: Refining the Sample Complexity of  Comparative Learning
abstract: Comparative learning, a recently introduced variation of the PAC (Probably
  Approximately Correct) framework, interpolates between the two standard extreme
  settings of realizable and agnostic PAC learning. In comparative learning the labeling
  is assumed to be from one hypothesis class (the source class) while the learnerâ€™s
  performance is to be measured against another hypothesis class (the benchmark class).
  This setup allows for incorporating more specific prior knowledge into PAC type
  learning bounds, which are known to be otherwise overly pessimistic. It also naturally
  represents model distillation tasks, where a predictor with specific requirements
  (such as being bounded in size or being interpretable) is trained on the labels
  from another model. A first sample complexity analysis of comparative learning established
  upper and lower bounds for general comparative learning. In this work, we propose
  a more fine grained view on this setting, distinguishing between proper learning
  and general (improper) learning. We derive novel upper and lower sample complexity
  bounds for both settings. In particular, we identify conditions for each of the
  regimes, and thereby exhibit how the rate depends on the relatedness of the two
  classes in perhaps unexpected ways.
