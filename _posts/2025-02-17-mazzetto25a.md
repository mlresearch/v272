title: Center-Based Approximation of a Drifting Distribution
abstract: 'We present a novel technique for computing a center-based approximation
  of a drifting distribution. Given $k \geq 1$ and a stream of data, whose distribution
  is changing over time, the goal is to compute, at each step, the best $k$ centers
  representation of the current distribution, despite possibly having only a single
  sample from the most recent distribution. In data mining, this is traditionally
  attempted through the sliding-window mechanism, where the analysis is performed
  on the most recent fixed-size segment of the data. The problems with this approach
  are twofold: (1) setting the correct window size is challenging; and (2) a fixed
  window size cannot effectively track changes in the distribution happening at variable
  speed. In this paper, we propose a new methodology that dynamically adjusts the
  window size based on the recent drift of the data. The challenge is that it is not
  possible to explicitly estimate the drift, as we may have only a single data point
  from each distribution. Our main contribution lies in providing a rigorous mathematical
  analysis, establishing both an upper bound via a dynamic window size algorithm,
  and a lower bound that shows the tightness of our approach.'
