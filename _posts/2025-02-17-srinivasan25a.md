title: High-accuracy sampling from constrained spaces with the Metropolis-adjusted
  Preconditioned Langevin Algorithm
abstract: 'We propose a first-order sampling method called the Metropolis-adjusted
  Preconditioned Langevin Algorithm for approximate sampling from a target distribution
  whose support is a proper convex subset of $\mathbb{R}^{d}$. Our proposed method
  is the result of applying a Metropolis-Hastings filter to the Markov chain formed
  by a single step of the preconditioned Langevin algorithm with a metric $\mathscr{G}$,
  and is motivated by the natural gradient descent algorithm for optimisation. We
  derive non-asymptotic upper bounds for the mixing time of this method for sampling
  from target distributions whose potentials are bounded relative to $\mathscr{G}$,
  and for exponential distributions restricted to the support. Our analysis suggests
  that if $\mathscr{G}$ satisfies stronger notions of self-concordance introduced
  in \citet{kook2024gaussian}, then these mixing time upper bounds have a strictly
  better dependence on the dimension than when $\mathscr{G}$ is merely self-concordant.
  Our method is a <em>high-accuracy</em> sampler due to the polylogarithmic dependence
  on the error tolerance in our mixing time upper bounds. '
