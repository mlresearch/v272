title: Effective Littlestone dimension
abstract: 'Delle Rose et al. (COLT’23)  introduced an effective version of the Vapnik-Chervonenkis
  dimension, and showed that it characterizes improper PAC learning with total computable
  learners. In this paper, we introduce and study a similar effectivization of the
  notion of Littlestone dimension.  Finite effective Littlestone dimension is a necessary
  condition for computable online learning but is not a sufficient one—which we already
  establish for classes of the effective Littlestone dimension 2. However, the effective
  Littlestone dimension equals the optimal mistake bound for computable learners in
  two special cases: a) for classes of Littlestone dimension 1 and b) when the learner
  receives as additional information an upper bound on the numbers to be guessed.
  Interestingly, a finite effective Littlestone dimension also guarantees that the
  class consists only of computable functions. '
