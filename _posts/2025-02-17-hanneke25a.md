title: Reliable Active Apprenticeship Learning
abstract: 'We propose a learning problem, which we call reliable active apprenticeship
  learning, for which we define a learning algorithm providing optimal performance
  guarantees, which we further show are sharply characterized by the eluder dimension
  of a policy class. In this setting, a learning algorithm is tasked with behaving
  optimally in an unknown environment given by a Markov decision process. The correct
  actions are specified by an unknown optimal policy in a given policy class. The
  learner initially does not know the optimal policy, but it has the ability to query
  an expert, which returns the optimal action for the current state. A learner is
  said to be reliable if, whenever it takes an action without querying the expert,
  its action is guaranteed to be optimal. We are then interested in designing a reliable
  learner which does not query the expert too often. We propose a reliable learning
  algorithm which provably makes the minimal possible number of queries, which we
  show is precisely characterized by the eluder dimension of the policy class. We
  further extend this to allow for imperfect experts, modeled as an oracle with noisy
  responses. We study two variants of this, inspired by noise conditions from classification:
  namely, Massart noise and Tsybakov noise. In both cases, we propose a reliable learning
  strategy which achieves a nearly-minimal number of queries, and prove upper and
  lower bounds on the optimal number of queries in terms of the noise conditions and
  the eluder dimension of the policy class.'
