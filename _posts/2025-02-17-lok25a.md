title: Error dynamics of mini-batch gradient descent with random reshuffling for least
  squares regression
abstract: We study the discrete dynamics of mini-batch gradient descent with random
  reshuffling for least squares regression. We show that the training and generalization
  errors depend on a sample cross-covariance matrix $Z$ between the original features
  $X$ and a set of new features $\widetilde{X}$ in which each feature is modified
  by the mini-batches that appear before it during the learning process in an averaged
  way. Using this representation, we establish that the dynamics of mini-batch and
  full-batch gradient descent agree up to leading order with respect to the step size
  using the linear scaling rule. However, mini-batch gradient descent with random
  reshuffling exhibits a subtle dependence on the step size that a gradient flow analysis
  cannot detect, such as converging to a limit that depends on the step size. By comparing
  $Z$, a non-commutative polynomial of random matrices, with the sample covariance
  matrix of $X$ asymptotically, we demonstrate that batching affects the dynamics
  by resulting in a form of shrinkage on the spectrum.
