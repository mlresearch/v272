title: Information-Theoretic Guarantees for Recovering Low-Rank Tensors from Symmetric
  Rank-One Measurements
abstract: We investigate the sample complexity of recovering tensors with low symmetric
  rank from sym- metric rank-one measurements, a setting particularly motivated by
  the study of higher-order inter- actions in statistics and the analysis of two-layer
  polynomial neural networks. Using a covering number argument, we analyze the performance
  of the symmetric rank minimization program and establish near-optimal sample complexity
  bounds when the underlying distribution is log-concave. Our measurement model involves
  random symmetric rank-one tensors, leading to involved proba- bility calculations.
  To address these challenges, we employ the Carbery-Wright inequality, a power- ful
  tool for studying anti-concentration properties of random polynomials, and leverage
  orthogonal polynomial expansions. Additionally, we provide a sample complexity lower
  bound via Fano’s inequality, and discuss broader implications of our results for
  two-layer polynomial networks.
