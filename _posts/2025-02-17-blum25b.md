title: A Model for Combinatorial Dictionary Learning and Inference
abstract: 'We are often interested in decomposing complex, structured data into simple
  components that explain the data. The linear version of this problem is well-studied
  as dictionary learning and factor analysis. In this work, we propose a combinatorial
  model in which to study this question, motivated by the way objects occlude each
  other in a scene to form an image. First, we identify a property we call “well-structuredness”
  of a set of low-dimensional components which ensures that no two components in the
  set are <em>too</em> similar. We show how well-structuredness is sufficient for
  learning the set of latent components comprising a set of sample instances. We then
  consider the problem: given a set of components and an instance generated from some
  unknown subset of them, identify which parts of the instance arise from which components.
  We consider two variants: (1) determine the minimal number of components required
  to explain the instance; (2) determine the <em>correct</em> explanation for as many
  locations as possible. For the latter goal, we also devise a version that is robust
  to adversarial corruptions, with just a slightly stronger assumption on the components.
  Finally, we show that the learning problem is computationally infeasible in the
  absence of any assumptions.'
