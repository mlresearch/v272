title: Efficient Optimal PAC Learning
abstract: Recent advances in the binary classification setting by Hanneke (2016) and
  Larsen (2023) have resulted in optimal PAC learners. These learners leverage, respectively,
  a clever deterministic subsampling scheme and the classic heuristic of bagging Breiman
  (1996). Both optimal PAC learners use, as a subroutine, the natural algorithm of
  empirical risk minimization. Consequently, the computational cost of these optimal
  PAC learners is tied to that of the empirical risk minimizer algorithm. In this
  work, we seek to provide an alternative perspective on the computational cost imposed
  by the link to the empirical risk minimizer algorithm. To this end, we show the
  existence of an optimal PAC learner, which offers a different tradeoff in terms
  of the computational cost induced by the empirical risk minimizer.
