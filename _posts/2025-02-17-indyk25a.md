title: Optimal and learned algorithms for the online list update problem with Zipfian
  accesses
abstract: 'The online list update problem is defined as follows: we are given a list
  of items and the cost to access any particular item is its position from the start
  of the list. A sequence of item accesses come online, and our goal is to dynamically
  reorder the list so that the aggregate access cost is small. We study the stochastic
  version of the problem where the items are accessed i.i.d. from an unknown distribution
  $p$. The study of the stochastic version goes back at least 60 years to McCabe.  In
  this paper, we first consider the simple online algorithm which swaps an accessed
  item with the item right before it, unless it is at the very front. This algorithm
  is known as the Transposition rule. We theoretically analyze the stationary behavior
  of Transposition and prove that its performance is within $1+o(1)$ factor of the
  optimal offline algorithm for access sequences sampled from heavy-tailed distributions,
  proving a conjecture of Rivest from 1976.  While the stationary behavior of the
  Transposition rule is theoretically optimal in the aforementioned i.i.d setting,
  it can catastrophically fail under adversarial access sequences where only the last
  and second to last items are repeatedly accessed. A desirable outcome would be a
  policy that performs well under both circumstances. To achieve this, we use reinforcement
  learning to design an adaptive policy that performs well for both the i.i.d. setting
  and the above-mentioned adversarial access. Unsurprisingly, the learned policy appears
  to be an interpolation between Move-to-Front and Transposition with its behavior
  closer to Move-to-Front for adversarial access sequences and closer to Transposition
  for sequences sampled from heavy tailed distributions suggesting that the policy
  is adaptive and capable of responding to patterns in the access sequence.'
